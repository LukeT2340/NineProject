                Growing up, model and dancer Ragavi Ragavan didn’t often see pictures of people who look like her. “As a young person, I was very impressionable, as most young people are. I was looking for permission to be myself and looking for people that look like me –

                With around one in four Australians born overseas and another 800,000 identifying as First Nations (<i>Australian Bureau of Statistics</i>), Ragavan’s experience is far from unique. So, when the opportunity came up for her to take part in a photoshoot for Getty Images, she jumped at the chance.
